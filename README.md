# challengeProgramming
This repository was created to add some programming challenges that I find on the internet.

I currently program in 3 languages, JS, C # and Python
I will try to do the challenges in at least 1 of the languages


To run C # code, it is necessary to have the .Net environment correctly installed.

With the environment working properly, use the command, to run the program
